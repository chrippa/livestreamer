-------------

CLI:
 - Added a ``--player-no-close`` option.

   list. If a stream is not available the next one in the list will be tried.
 - Now only resolves synonyms once when using ``--player-continuous-http``.
 - Removed the ``-u`` shortcut for ``--plugins``. This is a response to someone
   spreading the misinformation that ``-url`` is a sane parameter to use.
   It's technically valid, but due to the ``-u`` shortcut it would be
   interpreted by Python's argparse as ``--plugins --rtmpdump l`` which
   would cause livestreamer to look for a non-existing rtmpdump executable,
   thus disabling any RTMP streams. (#193)
