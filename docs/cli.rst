.. _cli:

Command Line Interface
======================

The CLI can be used to either pipe streams to a video player for playback or download them to a file.

Tutorial
--------

The CLI is designed to be as simple as possible to use, in two or less steps you can start playback
of your favorite stream in a desktop video player such as `VLC <http://videolan.org/>`_ or `MPlayer <http://www.mplayerhq.hu/>`_.

Let's say you want to watch the stream located on http://twitch.tv/day9tv, you start off by telling Livestreamer
where to to find information about your stream by giving the URL to ``livestreamer`` as the first argument.
You do not need to specify the whole URL including ``http://``, just ``twitch.tv/day9tv`` will do just fine.

.. code-block:: console

    $ livestreamer twitch.tv/day9tv
    [cli][info] Found matching plugin justintv for URL twitch.tv/day9tv
    Found streams: 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p (best), iphonehigh, iphonelow (worst)

Livestreamer will find out what streams are available and print them out for you to choose from. Simply give ``livestreamer``
the stream as the second argument and playback will start in your video player of choice.

The words printed next to stream names within a parantheses are synonyms and can be used when selecting stream to play.
In this case the ``best`` stream is a reference to the stream that is considered to be of highest quality, e.g ``720p``.

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ livestreamer twitch.tv/day9tv best
    [cli][info] Found matching plugin justintv for URL twitch.tv/day9tv
    [cli][info] Opening stream: 720p
    [cli][info] Starting player: vlc

The default player is `VLC <http://videolan.org/>`_, but it can be easily changed using the ``--player`` argument.
It is recommended to create a `Configuration file`_ for arguments you wish to be used every time.

    e.g. 'SES_USERNO=xxx; SES_STATE=xxx; SES_MEMBERNICK=xxx; SES_USERNICK=xxx;'

.. cmdoption:: --gomtv-username username

    Specify GOMTV username to allow access to streams

.. cmdoption:: --gomtv-password [password]

    Specify GOMTV password to allow access to streams (If
    left blank you will be prompted)


Configuration file
------------------

Writing the command line arguments every time is painful, that's why Livestreamer
is capable of reading arguments from a file instead, a sort of configuration file.
Livestreamer will look for this file in different locations depending on your platform:

**Unix-like OSs**
  ``~/.config/livestreamer/config``
  ``~/.livestreamerrc``

**Windows**
  ``%APPDATA%\livestreamer\livestreamerrc``


The file should contain one argument per line in the format ``option=value``, like this:

.. code-block:: console

    player=mplayer -cache 2048
    jtv-cookie=_twitch_session_id=xxxxxx; persistent=xxxxx;
    gomtv-cookie=SES_USERNO=xxx; SES_STATE=xxx; SES_MEMBERNICK=xxx; SES_USERNICK=xxx;


Common issues
-------------

**Livestreamer exits with error "Unable to read from stream" or "Error while executing subprocess" on Twitch/Justin.tv streams**

When building rtmpdump from source it may link with a already existing (probably older) librtmp version instead of using it's
own version.

On Debian/Ubuntu it is recommended to use the official packages of *librtmp0* and *rtmpdump* version
*2.4+20111222.git4e06e21* or newer. This version contains the necessary code to play Twitch/Justin.tv streams and
avoids any conflicts. It should be available in the testing or unstable repositories.

If you still want to build it yourself you can avoid the linking problem by building a static build of rtmpdump.

.. code-block:: console

    $ make SHARED=


**VLC fails to play with a error message**

VLC version *2.0.1* and *2.0.2* contains a bug that prevents it from reading data from standard input.
This has been fixed in version *2.0.3*.

**Streams are buffering/lagging**

By default most players do not cache the input from stdin, here is a few command arguments you can pass to some common players:

- ``mplayer --cache <kbytes>`` (between 1024 and 8192 is recommended)
- ``vlc --file-caching <milliseconds>`` (between 1000 and 10000 is recommended)

These options can be used by passing ``--player`` to ``livestreamer``.


Plugin specific usage
---------------------

Authenticating with Twitch/Justin.tv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's possible to access subscription based content on Twitch/Justin.tv by letting Livestreamer use your web browser sessions cookies.

Cookies should be specified in a key value list separated by a semicolon. In this case only the `_twitch_session_id` and `persistent` keys are required by Twitch/Justin.tv. For example:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ livestreamer --jtv-cookie "_twitch_session_id=xxxxxx; persistent=xxxxx;" twitch.tv/ignproleague
    [plugin.justintv][info] Attempting to authenticate using cookies
    [plugin.justintv][info] Successfully logged in as <username>


Extracting cookies from your web browser varies from browser to browser, try googling "<brower name> view cookies".
It's recommended to save these cookies in your `Configuration file`_ rather than specifying them manually every time.


Authenticating with GOMTV.net
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GOMTV.net requires authenticating with an account before allowing you to access any of their content.
This is done easiest by following these steps:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ livestreamer --gomtv-username user@email.com gomtv.net

This will cause Livestreamer to prompt you for your password and then attempt to login, giving you an output similar to this when successful:

.. sourcecode:: console

    $ livestreamer --gomtv-username user@email.com gomtv.net
    Enter GOMTV password:
    [plugin.gomtv][info] Attempting to authenticate with username and password
    [plugin.gomtv][info] Successfully logged in as <username>
    [plugin.gomtv][info] Cookie for reusing this session: SES_MEMBERNO=xxxxxxxxxx; SES_STATE=xxxxxxxxxxx; SES_MEMBERNICK=xxxxxx; SES_USERNICK=username;


The important part of this output is the last line, that's the cookies used to access this login session. To use these cookies pass them to the ``--gomtv-cookie`` option. It's recommended to save these cookies in your `Configuration file`_ rather than specifying them manually every time.

These instructions are for authenticating with a regular user account, if you are using a `Facebook <http://facebook.com/>`_ or `Twitter <http://twitter.com/>`_ account to authenticate you'll need to extract your cookies from your web browser instead. Extracting cookies from your web browser varies from browser to browser, try googling "<brower name> view cookies".


Advanced usage
--------------

Playing built-in streaming protocols directly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are many types of streaming protocols used by services today and Livestreamer
implements most of them. It is possible to tell Livestreamer to access a streaming
protocol directly instead of relying on a plugin to find the information for you.

A protocol can be accessed directly by specifying it in the URL format: `protocol://path key=value`.

For example, to access a RTMP stream which requires parameters to be passed along to the stream:

.. code-block:: console

    $ livestreamer "rtmp://streaming.server.net/playpath live=1 swfVfy=http://server.net/flashplayer.swf"


Most streaming technologies simply requires you to pass a HTTP URL, this is an Adobe HDS stream:

.. code-block:: console

    $ livestreamer hds://http://streaming.server.net/playpath/manifest.f4m


Livestreamer currently supports these protocols:


+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Name                          | Prefix                                        |
+===============================+===============================================+
| Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming  | hds://                                        |
+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Akamai HD Adaptive Streaming  | akamaihd://                                   |
+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Apple HTTP Live Streaming     | hls:// hlvsvariant://                         |
+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Real Time Messaging Protocol  | rtmp:// rmpte:// rmpts:// rtmpt:// rtmpte://  |
+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
