plugins to get an idea of how it works.

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `livestreamer` for local development.

1. Fork the `livestreamer` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/livestreamer.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv livestreamer
    $ cd livestreamer/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

  Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the
tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ python setup.py test
    $ tox

  To get tox, just pip install it into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests if it's a core feature.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. When creating a pull request, make sure it's on the correct branch.
   These branches are currently used:

   - master: Only critical fixes that need to be released ASAP.
   - develop: Everything else.

4. The pull request should work for Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3, and for PyPy. Check 
   https://travis-ci.org/chrippa/livestreamer/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
